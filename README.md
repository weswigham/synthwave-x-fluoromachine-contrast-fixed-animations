## Why?

The job of a software developer is hard and often too serious. You always have to be productive and effective. But sometimes you need to take the time to just be a nerd 🤓 or to just have fun again. This theme is exactly for such times! Such nerdy times need to be celebrated accordingly 🎉🦄

## Installation

Unfortunately, the current installation is a bit complicated.
The following steps must be performed to install the theme:

1. Install this theme
2. Install [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) VS Code extension
3. Link the CSS file from this extension in your VS Code settings.json:

```
On Mac it might look something like the snippet below:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/weswigham.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-fixed-animations-1.0.0/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/weswigham.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-fixed-animations-1.0.0/epic-80s-transitions.css",
    "file:///Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/weswigham.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-fixed-animations-1.0.0/logo.css"
  ]
}

Windows might resemble:

{
  "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/weswigham.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-fixed-animations-1.0.0/synthwave-x-fluoromachine.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/weswigham.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-fixed-animations-1.0.0/epic-80s-transitions.css",
    "file:///C:/Users/{your username}/.vscode/extensions/weswigham.synthwave-x-fluoromachine-contrast-fixed-animations-1.0.0/logo.css"
  ]
}

Low spec machines (or just to disable animations):
Instead of "epic-80s-transitions.css" use "epic-80s-transitions-low.css"

```

4. `epic-80s-transitions.css` is optional and brings crazy 80's animations into your VS Code!
5. `logo.css` is also optional and changes VS Code logo.
6. Edit settings.json and add:

```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
	"minimap.background": "#00000000",
	"tab.inactiveBackground": "#0c0e14"
}
```

7. From the command panel, select `Reload Custom CSS and JS`. You'll need to run this command every time vscode updates.
